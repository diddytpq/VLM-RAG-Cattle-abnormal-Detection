    "output": "To determine if the cow’s behavior is normal or mounting, we analyze key indicators:  \n- **Mounting behavior** typically involves physical actions like lifting the head/neck, positioning to mount another animal (e.g., straddling), or showing aggression toward a target.  \n- In the video, the central cow stands still with a relaxed posture; there are no signs of lifting limbs, approaching another cow for mounting, or engaging in mating-related movements. Other cows are resting on the ground, and no interaction resembling mounting occurs.  \n\nSince none of the characteristics of mounting behavior are present, the cow’s action is consistent with normal rest or observation.  \n\nStatus: Normal"
