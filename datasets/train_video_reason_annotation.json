The sequence begins with both animals already in this position and progresses with them remaining stationary and separated by a small distance. There is no movement in their legs or bodies, and their relative positions to one another do not change throughout the clip. Crucially, neither cow attempts to stand up, walk toward the other in a longitudinal alignment, lift its forelegs, or place its body or front legs onto the back of the companion animal. Since mounting behavior is an active interaction between standing animals, and both cows are observed to be lying down and immobile, this footage clearly does not contain mounting behavior."
